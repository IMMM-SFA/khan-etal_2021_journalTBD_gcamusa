This study examines the coevolution of multiple sectors including water, energy and land in response to socioeconomic, policy, and climate drivers across the United States in a global context using the Global Change Analysis Model - USA (GCAM-USA). Consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways - Representative Concentration Pathways (SSP-RCP) scenario framework, we combine different socioeconomic pathways with both moderate and more severe climate projections developed from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) archive. Our study contributes to the literature by focusing on subnational (state and basin level) economy-energy-water-land interactions and dynamics within the U.S linked to the rest of the world through trade in international commodity markets. Conditions outside of the U.S. dynamically affect sub-national conditions within the U.S. and vice versa.
